        <h4>Our History</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="span13">
        <p>In fall 2005, HUWIB held its first annual Intercollegiate Business Convention, attracting over 400 students from 30 universities. 
    In its third year, 2007, the annual IBC had more than 700 registrants and is continuing to grow. Each year, HUWIB members also venture
     on outreach trips to New York and other cities, most recently Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, and Las Vegas, to explore opportunities 
    in the business world. Past visits have included discussions with CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, panels with representatives from prominent 
    firms, and meetings with associates in a variety of industries. The trips are designed to give students a well-rounded sense of the different 
    opportunities that await them in the business world. Along with these large-scale events, HUWIB also holds many business development workshops 
    and smaller meetings during the year. Such events, along with HUWIB socials, allow members to meet and learn from each other in an informal setting.</p>
    <p>
    In the past, HUWIB has visited prominent firms such as Goldman Sachs, Time Inc., Estee Lauder, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Disney.
     HUWIB members have also had the opportunity to interact with many successful professionals in the business world, including Ann Moore 
    (CEO of Time Inc.), Marilyn Crawford (CEO of Primetime Omnimedia), Janet Hanson (CEO of Milestone Capital and 85 Broads), Christine Beauchamp (former 
    CEO of Victoria's Secret Beauty), Jeff Zucker (Chairman of NBC Universal), Chuck Williams (Founder of Williams Sonoma), to name a few.</p>

    <p>HUWIB events are planned throughout the year to educate and support
    the professional development of our members and are funded through sponsorships and grants. Our largest event, the Intercollegiate Business Convention, occurs every fall and draws over 1200 dynamic young female leaders from around the world. The development of our membership extends
